-- Retention policy for 2 years
SELECT add_retention_policy('transactions', INTERVAL '2 years');

-- Continuous aggregates for common queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_metrics
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT
  time_bucket('1 hour', timestamp) AS hour,
  COUNT(*) as tx_count,
  AVG(amount) as avg_amount,
  SUM(amount) as total_volume
FROM transactions
GROUP BY hour;
```
