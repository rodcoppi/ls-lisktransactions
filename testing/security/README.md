## Security Testing Scope

### OWASP Top 10 Testing

1. **Injection** - SQL, NoSQL, Command injection testing
2. **Broken Authentication** - Session management, credential testing
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure** - Data encryption, transmission security
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)** - XML processing security
5. **Broken Access Control** - Authorization bypass testing
6. **Security Misconfiguration** - Server and application configuration
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Input validation and output encoding
8. **Insecure Deserialization** - Object deserialization security
9. **Known Vulnerabilities** - Dependency and component security
10. **Insufficient Logging** - Security event logging and monitoring

### Authentication Security

- Password policy enforcement
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) testing
- Session management security
- Password reset functionality
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Credential storage security

### Authorization Testing

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Privilege escalation testing
- API endpoint authorization
- Resource access permissions
- Administrative function security

### Data Protection

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- PII handling and protection
- GDPR compliance testing
- Data retention policies
- Secure data disposal

### Network Security

- HTTPS configuration and enforcement
- TLS/SSL certificate validation
- Content Security Policy (CSP) testing
- HTTP security headers
- API security testing

## Testing Methodologies

### Automated Security Testing

- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security scanning

### Manual Security Testing

- Penetration testing techniques
- Social engineering assessments
- Physical security evaluation
- Security code review

## Compliance Standards

Security testing ensures compliance with:

- OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- GDPR data protection requirements
- SOC 2 security controls
- Industry-specific security standards
