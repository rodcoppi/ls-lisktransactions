# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for building a scalable dashboard system
that can handle real-time data visualization, support high concurrency, and
provide excellent performance.

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend

- **Next.js 14 with App Router**: Full-stack React framework with server-side
  rendering
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Recharts**: React-based charting library for data visualization
- **React 18**: Latest React with concurrent features

### Backend

- **Next.js API Routes**: Integrated API layer with the frontend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for consistent language across stack

### Database

- **PostgreSQL 15**: Robust relational database with excellent performance
- **TimescaleDB Extension**: Time-series optimization for metric data

### Caching

- **Redis 7.0**: Distributed caching for session management and data caching
- **In-memory LRU Cache**: Application-level caching for frequently accessed
  data

### Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and load balancing
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Monitoring and observability

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Performance**: TimescaleDB provides excellent time-series data handling
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript + Next.js provides excellent DX
- **Scalability**: Redis caching and PostgreSQL can handle high loads
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of packages and community support
- **Consistency**: Single language (TypeScript/JavaScript) across the stack

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Multiple technologies require expertise in different areas
- **Resource Usage**: Memory-intensive stack requiring adequate server resources
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn TimescaleDB-specific optimizations

### Mitigations

- Comprehensive documentation and training for the team
- Gradual introduction of complex features
- Monitoring tools to track resource usage and performance
