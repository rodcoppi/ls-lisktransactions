# ADR-002: Clean Architecture Implementation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Deciders**: Architecture Team

## Context

We need to define the application architecture to ensure maintainability,
testability, and separation of concerns as the system grows in complexity.

## Decision

We will implement Clean Architecture with the following layer structure:

1. **Presentation Layer**: UI components, pages, and user interaction handlers
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases, services, and application-specific business
   rules
3. **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, entities, and domain services
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns, databases, APIs, and
   implementation details

### Directory Structure

```
src/
├── presentation/     # React components, pages, hooks
├── application/      # Use cases, services, events
├── domain/          # Business logic, entities, interfaces
└── infrastructure/  # Database, cache, external APIs
```

### Dependency Rule

Dependencies flow inward: Presentation → Application → Domain ← Infrastructure

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Feature-based Structure

```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   ├── analytics/
│   └── users/
```

**Rejected**: While good for small applications, doesn't scale well with complex
business logic.

### Option 2: Traditional MVC

```
src/
├── controllers/
├── models/
└── views/
```

**Rejected**: Too tightly coupled and doesn't separate business logic from
infrastructure concerns.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations without affecting business logic
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growth and complexity
- **Team Collaboration**: Clear boundaries for different expertise areas

### Negative

- **Initial Complexity**: More boilerplate code initially
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand Clean Architecture principles
- **Over-engineering Risk**: May be overkill for simple features

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Domain layer should have no external dependencies
2. Use dependency injection for cross-layer communication
3. Interfaces defined in domain, implemented in infrastructure
4. Application layer orchestrates use cases
5. Presentation layer only handles UI concerns
